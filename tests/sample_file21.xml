== It's not too good ==

There's nothing here, but I'm working on it. [[User:Crazy coyote|Crazy coyote]] ([[User talk:Crazy coyote|talk]]) 05:01, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

== Name ? ==

Just a quick question - was her name Belkis Ayón or Belkis Ayón Manso ? If the latter, then that's what I'd have expected the article to be called - or is there something unusual about the way Cuban names are formed ?

:Everyone seems to refer to her without the &quot;Manso&quot;, but on [http://www.belkisayon.com/biography/index.php?lang=eng&amp;show=studies this page] her site calls her the full name. Also, her full name gets 735 hits on Google, while without the Manso it gets 9,040. I decided to go without the Manso, but include in the name anyway...I can't really tell which is true, since the site made in her name uses both. Should someone change the title? Not sure what to do with that. [[User:Crazy coyote|Crazy coyote]] ([[User talk:Crazy coyote|talk]]) 02:22, 28 April 2008 (UTC)
