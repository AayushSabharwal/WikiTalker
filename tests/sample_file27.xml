Hi, I changed the intro to say that this is the fourteenth Killing Joke album, someone has said that they think this is incorrect.  There's not really any way to cite a reliable source for this besides simply counting how many albums they've done.  I think the confusion may arise from a review quote that says it's their fifteenth album, but this is a mistake on the reviewer's part.  Anyway, I refer to the Killing Joke Discography page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Joke_discography  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€”&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/185.41.44.248|185.41.44.248]] ([[User talk:185.41.44.248|talk]]) 17:01, 18 November 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
