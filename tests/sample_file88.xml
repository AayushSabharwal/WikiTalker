Dear Editors,

CEMI is a not for profit organization who connects the mining industry to academics (Universities across Canada, for example: Queen's University, Laurentian University, Laval University, and the University of Toronto). Recently, CEMI was awarded a multi-million dollar grant to fund collaborative research in the area of mine ventilation by the Government of Canada. CEMI is also funded by Vale Inco and Xstrata Nickel who each committed five million dollars. These dollars where matched by the Ontario Government in 2006. 

One of CEMI's mandates is to share the information it gathers with the mining industry, government, and the academic community. Have a wikipedia page will aid in sharing this information to our partners and the mining community at large. This why CEMI qualifies as noteworthy for wikipedia.

We are currently linked to the following wikipedia pages:
[[MIRARCO]]
[[Greater Sudbury]]
[[Laurentian University]]
[[David Courtemanche]]

As a new member, I appreicate allowing me the time to figure out this new system. Sorry about the copyright material, it was content that I wrote specifically for the CEMI website. I hope I have corrected the mistake. I will be updating the site often, once you give final approval to the information posted. Any further help that you can offer is most welcome.
