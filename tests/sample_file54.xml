== Marvel Music Tag ==

Cut a lot of excess details that weren't supported by primary sources. Changed language to reflect the one sentence that still is. There isn't a ton of info on this out there. Edits should be sufficient to remove the tag, but let me know if anyone objects. [[User:Balle010|Balle010]] ([[User talk:Balle010|talk]]) 23:41, 23 June 2019 (UTC)
