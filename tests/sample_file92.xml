Can you added an Dutch-Based Announcers?  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ejbaluyot|Ejbaluyot]] ([[User talk:Ejbaluyot#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ejbaluyot|contribs]]) 01:11, 20 August 2017 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
: Please stop adding these strange sentences, they don't make any sense. Also information on [[BNN]] and [[VARA]] specifically is not needed as they already have their own articles. The announcers section was recently rewritten on the Dutch page, I can add it based on that.

This article is very hard to understand and a lot of sentences don't make sense. I cleaned up the infobox and introduction but it needs more work [[Special:Contributions/37.228.245.132|37.228.245.132]] ([[User talk:37.228.245.132|talk]]) 17:02, 20 August 2017 (UTC)
:I cleaned up the article some more and removed all poorly written sentences. It could use some more information added but for now it's fine [[Special:Contributions/37.228.245.132|37.228.245.132]] ([[User talk:37.228.245.132|talk]]) 17:42, 20 August 2017 (UTC)
::Not really. What, for example, does '''this''' mean » ''BNNVARA will start to show programs though VARA and for radio'' « :? -- [[User:Picapica|Picapica]] ([[User talk:Picapica|talk]]) 22:44, 12 June 2019 (UTC)

== So what is it? ==

It's an &quot;association?&quot; That's almost meaningless. &lt;BR&gt;  Like some kids in Mom's  basement with a computer?  &lt;BR&gt; Like a television station?  A network like [[CBS]] or ABC? Public broadcaster like [[NPR]] or [[PBS]]? Like [[Pacifica Foundation]] or [[KPFA]] non-commercial radio? What is its coverage? Its budget? Earnings? etc etc.... What is it? —Cheers! &lt;BR&gt; --[[Special:Contributions/2602:306:CFCE:1EE0:3044:A2C3:2683:987B|2602:306:CFCE:1EE0:3044:A2C3:2683:987B]] ([[User talk:2602:306:CFCE:1EE0:3044:A2C3:2683:987B|talk]]) 00:02, 8 December 2018 (UTC)Doug Bashford

:OK, I cleaned up the lede section by removing the duplicate history. But needs work. Suggest also: [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lead section)]] Cheers! &lt;BR&gt; --[[Special:Contributions/2602:306:CFCE:1EE0:3044:A2C3:2683:987B|2602:306:CFCE:1EE0:3044:A2C3:2683:987B]] ([[User talk:2602:306:CFCE:1EE0:3044:A2C3:2683:987B|talk]]) 00:40, 8 December 2018 (UTC)Doug Bashford</text>
