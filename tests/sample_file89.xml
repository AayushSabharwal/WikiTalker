== First Alien? ==

Mr. Spock was not the first alien on T.V.
Uncle Martin(played by Ray Walston) on My Favorite Martian was aired on CBS from September 29, 1963. Several years before Star Trek was aired on September 8, 1966.
== First Vulcan? ==

Was he the first Vulcan in Starfleet? [[User:Magic Pickle|Magic Pickle]] 20:14, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

No, he wasn't. The First Vulcan, was earlier In the 2100s, It may have been T'pol.

Spock is NOT Vulcan. He is half human, half Vulcan.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.42.35.247|78.42.35.247]] ([[User talk:78.42.35.247|talk]]) 19:28, 13 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mission failed? ==

Where exactly in the tenth film did it say that Spock's mission was a failure, and where is it said that Spock is now dead?

[[User:172.209.224.1|172.209.224.1]] 01:21, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)

It doesn't say explicitly that it was a failure but since Vulcans and Romulans aren't reunited in the tenth movie, it seems that he didn't succeed in bringing them closer. BTW the article says &quot;Zar returns to the past at the end of the novel, but also reveals he is sterile&quot; -- exactly where is this sentence in the novel ''Time For Yesterday''? I read it but I don't remember Zar being sterile. [[User:Alensha|Alensha]] 21:42, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I read the novel about 10-15 years ago and there was a conversation, somewhere in there, where Zar asks McCoy to sterilize him and McCoy says that he would.  Either the author or the editors put that in the book to close the loop as to whether or not Spcok could have grandchildren.  P.S.- I dont think Spock is dead either.  Indeed, in Star Trek Nemesis the cooperation seen at the end of the film, i.e. when the Romulan military turns on Shinzon, would indicate that there is something still going on with reunification efforts. [[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 1 Nov 2004

::I found that part in the book. McCoy says Zar is able to have healthy children so there's no need to sterilize him but he will do it if Zar really wants it. I always thought Zar changed his mind after McCoy reassured him, but now I'm not sure. I don't think Spock is dead (at least, I hope he is still living :-) [[User:Alensha|Alensha]] 18:50, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: I would add this comment to the bottom of the page, but since &quot;Zar&quot; was debated here, I thought I'd put it here for it to be seen.  The article as it now stands mentions the novel but does not actually clarify that &quot;Zar&quot; is the name of the son of Spock in the book.  Someone who hasn't read the book would wonder who Zar was, as I did.  Just a bit of clarification, one sentence, would be good.

== First or last name? ==

I haven't seen &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; in a long time, in which we first learn that Vulcans have two names. Question: has it been established that Spock is his FIRST or his SECOND name? I've been going under the impression it's his first name, but the introduction to this article says otherwise. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 01:21, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
:&quot;Spock&quot; is apparently  his surname.
::I don't think so, since we have seen him referred to as &quot;Spock, son of Sarek&quot;, etc. I believe it is his first name, unless canon supports that every Vulcan has a different family name. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 17:59, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
:::In &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, what she actually says is &quot;You never told me if you had another name, Mr. Spock&quot; (yes, I checked, I'm a nerd). In some cultures, the family name is last, in some it comes first. How's this: his family name is unpronouncable, Spock is his familiar/personal name, Spock is his last name, and everybody's happy.  [[User:Roygbiv666|Roygbiv666]] 00:16, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
::::Unpronounceable in what way? There are plenty of things that are unpronounceable to speakers of certain languages that dominate commerce on Earth in the early 21st century yet are perfectly pronounceable by native speakers of other human languages. Can you pronounce [[Nuxalk language#Syllables|&quot;he had held a bunchberry plant&quot; in Nuxalk]], consonants with precise places of articulation in [[Ubykh phonology|Ubykh]], or words with clicks in [[ǃKung language|!Kung]] or [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]?

*The article says Spock whispers his name to the Romulan Commander in &quot;The Enterprise Incident.&quot;  No, I don't think he does.  She is the one, in fact, who whispers HER name to him, whereupon he says something like &quot;How rare and wonderful.&quot;[[User:Sir Rhosis|Sir Rhosis]] 01:26, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

Yes, I confirm this: She, the romulan commander, whispers HER name to him, Spock, and have deleted that false statetment in the article.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/201.58.246.248|201.58.246.248]] ([[User talk:201.58.246.248|talk]]) 19:50, 24 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Anon User Christian Statements ==

There is an anon user who keeps adding that Spock has a &quot;Christian&quot; name.  The user has made this addition at least five times over the past 2-3 days.  I have attempted leaving messages on this persons talk page but to no avail.  The person is logging under several different IP addresses, as well, probably because of a rotating server.

In any event, I think we'll all agree that saying things like Vulcans are Christians and that Spock is a Christian and has a Christian name is not based on any evidence in Star Trek.  I will continue to revert this person's comments in line with the policy of [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]].  I hate to be mean to a newbie, but if it continues it might become a vandalism issue. -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 05:13, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
: Be careful not to violate the three revert rule. You might need to consult an admin on this since the anon seems to be pretty insistent about it. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 18:02, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
::Good point.  The guy hasnt been on in a few days.  If he does come back, it might become a vandalism issue if we all agree that saying Vulcans are Christians is [[patent nonsense]] and can be reverted without discussion. -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 18:05, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

I think there may be a misunderstanding here. In many parts of the world &quot;Christian name&quot; simply means a first name; it doesn't imply anything about religion. So all the poster probably means is that Spock has a first name. In fact I seem to remember a sequence from one of the TOS episodes where some woman falls in love with Spock, something like this:

:&lt;s&gt;Woman: Do you have a Christian name?&lt;/s&gt;  Leila Kolomi: You never told me if you had another name, Mr. Spock. 
:&lt;s&gt;Spock: You would never be able to pronounce it.&lt;/s&gt; Spock: You couldn't pronounce it.

Since I think &quot;Christian name&quot; was more likely to be used as a synonym for &quot;first name&quot; in the US in the sixties, it may have gone exactly like that. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 18:11, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

::&quot;Christian name&quot; is not a synonym for &quot;first name&quot; as it has further meaning besides simply meaning &quot;first name&quot;. It means &quot;First name as formalized in a christening (sp?) ceremony in a christian church. Since Spock is not, has not, and very likely never will become a christian, then it is a misnomer in the context of the article. Yes, the term is commonly used in the US to mean first or given name, it has greater significance than just that and thus cannot be ascribed to Spock, who very obviously is not a member of that religion.

: Fair comment, although if you check some of the Edit summaries there does appear to be an intent on the part of the anon to suggest that Vulcans might be Christians. Are you sure this dialogue appears in the episode? I know there is an exchange, but I don't recall Spock being specifically asked for his &quot;Christian&quot; name ... only his &quot;other&quot; name. Anyone got the DVD handy? [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 18:15, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

:Possibly the anon user is doing the misunderstanding. I suggest we put the info back in a form that can't be misinterpreted. I'm pretty certain that, whatever the phraseology, nothing more religious than &quot;first name&quot; was implied.

::There is no misunderstanding. The term &quot;christian name&quot; has a subtext that has no place in the article. That is not open to interpretation. The intent of the original editor who put in the phrase, while open to interpretation, is irrelevant to the conversation. The only reason FOR this discussion is the subtext of the phrase &quot;christian name&quot;, thus the phrase will be removed and the discussion is closed.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/148.61.216.116|148.61.216.116]] ([[User talk:148.61.216.116|talk]]) 21:50, 25 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Finally found a reference: according to [http://ponilla.org/Nimoy/Interviews_LK2.htm this interview] with [[Leonard Nimoy]] Spock had a first name which could not be pronounced. &quot;The only reference to his first name I recall is an episode which includes a beautiful love scene. In the end she said: 'You never told me your first name' and I said: 'You wouldn't be able to pronounce it'. &quot; [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 18:27, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
:: In light of the corrected quote (see above), it's pretty clear that the episode doesn't specify whether the &quot;unpronouncable&quot; name is his first or last name. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 13:37, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

I think this comes from FANON. Spock's mother Amanda is a Christian, and did read the Bible to Spock. This is not included in CANON, but has been generally accepted by fans since the 1960s. I don't remember the entire legend, but it allowed Spock to integrate into Human (Terran) society and Starfleet more easily. Nimoy himself is a very proud Jew and includes elements of Judaism into the character of Spock. This fan legend has the same weight as T for Tiberius, or Hikaru as Sulu's name. It's accepted as fact even if it isn't shown on screen. It wasn't until ST:VI that Tiberius and Hikaru were both confirmed as CANON. The painting in Spock's quarters, &quot;Expulsion from the Garden&quot; could be a covert way of acknowledging the legend without expressly painting Spock or his mother Amanda as Christians. Logically, a Vulcan would not decorate his quarters with Human origin mythology, nor would he be as familiar with Genesis as shown in ST:II, unless his Human mother introduced him to it.
:A Vulcan could very easily be aware of Earth Human mythology for many reasons besides believing in it. I know quite a bit about Norse mythology but I don't think Odin had anything to do with the creation of the universe. I know about Christianity but I don't think there's an unnamed sky god who created the universe in 6 days. No reason for Spock to believe it either, among other things, it's totally illogical.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/148.61.216.116|148.61.216.116]] ([[User talk:148.61.216.116|talk]]) 21:46, 25 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Journey to Babel ==

I would like to include this from the episode &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;:

After Spock's parents have come aboard, Kirk addresses Amanda as &quot;Mrs. Sarek.&quot;  

Amanda replies, &quot;Amanda. You couldn't pronounce the Vulcan family name.&quot;

&quot;Can you?&quot;

&quot;Oh, after a fashion, and after many years of practice...&quot;

In an interview, D.C. Fontana suggested a series of consonants which could be the family name.  So of course fans picked on that as being the (non-canon) family name:  Xtmprszntwfld.  And don't ask me why I can remember that, but I don't remember what interview that was. :) 

I'm not totally sure if, in Amanda's initial reply to Kirk, she used the phrase &quot;family name.&quot;  I think I remember it right.

Maybe it's worth asking--if Kirk found Spock's family name too difficult, would he call him &quot;Mister&quot; followed by his first name?  

Everybody in and outside of Starfleet consistently called him &quot;Mr. Spock.&quot;

Jimmy Carter's National Security Chief was Zbigniew Brzezinski.  Did anybody ever call him &quot;Mr. Zbigniew?&quot;  Not a perfect example, since his first name is only a little less difficult than his last name. 

I remember a non-canon source which suggested his first name is Sareku, son of Sarek; his middle name is Spock and his family name is Xtmprszntwfld.

== Yesteryear references ==

I mentioned this on Kchishol1970's talk page as well, but I'll put the question out. Is there any source that says for certain that Yesteryear is considered canon? My understanding is there are no exceptions, and that the Encyclopedia and Chronology are not considered authoritative on this matter. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 17:04, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Canon vs. non-canon ==

I think we need a clearer indication of which material is canonical and which isn't. At the time of this writing, one of the paragraphs is simply prefixed with &quot;[Non-canon]:&quot;. Not only is this bracketed text a less-than-ideal header, it doesn't make it clear whether it pertains only to a single paragraph, or to all text from that point forward (although clearly some of the later paragraphs reference canonical sources). Perhaps the Biography section should be divided into subsections? [[User:Ringbang|Ringbang]] 00:04, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
: The paragraph in question appears to be a synopsis of the TAS episode &quot;Yesteryear&quot;. I think a better intro than &quot;non-canon&quot; can be found for this, though I wouldn't suggest going too much into why TAS is not canon since that's covered elsewhere. I agree the biography section could be split up a bit. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 01:53, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

== Miscellaneous ==

I fixed some factual errors involving the '''Nerve Pinch''' as well as the '''Mind Meld'''.

== Star Trek devotees, I need your help ==

Throughout the (1966-69) Star Trek: TOS, Spock wears 2 full stripes around his wrists ,which is the rank of Commander, yet in the first season (I think) ,He's descibed as a Lieutenant Commander. Could someone explain? Is this a blooper? [[User:Mightberight/wrong]] 22:27, 29 October 2005 (EST).
: I don't believe the rank system settled until the third season. If I recall correctly, Kirk wears two full stripes in Where No Man Has Gone Before, yet holds the rank of captain. But the way you describe it, it just sounds like Spock got a promotion that was never addressed in the series. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 21:55, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

It may be helpful to consider the difference between rank and position.  A person may hold the position of Captain of a ship and have the rank of Commander.   -- William Carraway 26 Aug 06

In most real world navies such an officer would be called &quot;Skipper&quot; to avoid confusion. Gene was a WW2 bomber pilot and would know the difference. Jack Kennedy was the Skipper of PT109 not the captain.

It is an oddity -- despite wearing the full commander's stripes, he is referred to as &quot;Lieutenant Commander&quot; in several episodes (The Menagerie, Court Martial). --[[User:EEMeltonIV|EEMeltonIV]] 04:18, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

It would have helped if they had just copied the naval system completely rather than partially like they did for ST:TNG.  It certainly would have been less confusing.  Of course, it would also help if uniforms did not change on a whim. [[User:Will Pittenger|Will]] 06:05, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
:My guess is, it was a script writers mistake. As Captain Kirk is the commander (CO) of the Enterprise, writers may have looked at position more then rank, somehow called Spock 'Lt.Cmder' as meaning the Commander's (the CO's) Lieutenant (next in command). Sure wish I had a varifiable source for this. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] 20:44, 20 December 2006 (UTC)








I wasn't quite sure where to say this... but Nimoy wasn't reluctant to be in the second movie. And when people say that it was in his contract that Spock was to die, or that they reached an agreement that Spock was supposed to die is not true. Don't believe me? check the intreview with Nimoy at the end of the first season, disc 8. He says so himself. Reflections on Spock.  [[User:Spocks-girl|Spocks-girl]]
Nimoy contradicts himself. Read &quot;I Am Spock&quot; he hated the way his character had been treated by Heinekin and The Motion Picture and only signed onto Wrath once they asked him if he'd like a death scene.

== Mind meld ==

I don't get the Vulcan mind meld stuff, I thought only full Vulcans can perform mind melds; like how only full Betazoids can read minds and half ones can only read emotions. The EMH once said not even Vulcan mind masters can perform mind melds sucessfully everytime. Spock can't even control his emotions all the time so how does he do mind melds? [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]

I do have a theory, and that is that it is the blend of human, and vulcan. That What every vulcan needs is the element of guesswork, Or that because he is half human, He does not fully hide his emotions, thus leaving him enough thought to work on the mind meld..[[User:Captain Eric|Captain Eric]] 06:13, 1 July 2007 (UTC)

One that goes the other way (i.e. &quot;Lieutenant Dan&quot;) is Lieutenant Hawk, who has first name Sean given in the article, but I don't recall one spoken on-screen to make it canon.

== Requested move to ''Spock'', et al. ==

[[Spock]] → ''[[Spock (disambiguation)]]'' / [[Mr. Spock]] → '''''[[Spock]]''''' – The proposed simpler article name reflects the prevailing form for this iconic character in the [[Star Trek]] universe ... and perhaps outside of fandom.  Given the prevalence of the sole term to refer to this character vis-à-vis others (including the current article name), [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)|it's arguable that there's anything precluding such a move]].  To elaborate: most people looking for Spock (ST) will either type in &quot;[[Spock]]&quot; or &quot;[[Mr. Spock]]&quot;.  Someone wanting [[Benjamin Spock]] would either type that name in or use &quot;[[Dr. Spock]]&quot;.  Other meanings (e.g., [[2309 Mr. Spock|the namesake asteroid]], etc.) are unlikely prevalent enough and are already accounted for (or should be) through unique article names and redirects.

Beforehand, the creation of the dedicated disambiguation page is also proposed, which would contain the entries currently in the [[Spock]] dab.  [[User:E Pluribus Anthony|E Pluribus Anthony]] | [[User talk:E Pluribus Anthony|''talk'']] | 18:55, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

== Spock's death and rebirth ==

I added some details from the novelization as a way of adding a possible explanation of why Kirk had Spock buried in space over the Genesis planet - not to replace any details from the movie with details from the book.  I know probably a lot of people have not read the novelization, but it certainly helps to explain the possible motivations behind Kirk's decision not to return Spock to Vulcan and the motivation behind the space burial.

I also added some more details about the events covered in the third film dealing with the recovery of Spock's body and the refusion of the katra with his body.  Such as how Spock had accomplished the transfer of his mind into another person, Sarek's request of Kirk to perform this mission, and Kirk's explanation to Spock of why he had done this thing.&lt;br&gt;

== Spock news ==

&quot;Recent [[Evidence|evidence]] conclusively proves that Mr Spock is not [[Half|half]] [[human]] [[And|and]] [[Half|half]] [[Vulcan_%28Star_Trek%29|Vulcan]], he is in fact fully Vulcan. His late mother, previously thought to have been human, was in fact Vulcan.&quot;

::*Are you saying that his father was into bestiality?
:::*Are ''you'' saying that humans are beasts? I've only been a fan of the show for a few weeks, and even I know that Spock is Half Human. Where did you even get that quote? It seems to me, and I know that this is speculation, that you probably made it up because you were uncomfortable with the members of two different species reproducing. And to change his mixed parentage would ruin the character. He's supposed to be at a constant internal conflict between his logical vulcan side and his emotional human side. On the subject of you saying his having Vulcan characteristics meaning that he must be fully vulcan: That doesn't mean anything except that Vulcan Genes are dominant. I know a girl whose father is black and mother is white, but if you were to hazard a guess as to her race, you'd never guess that she was of mixed race. Also, because I can't go on a single rant like this without bursting some bubbles, he's a fictional character. There is no &quot;evidence&quot; that could possibly prove anything about something that doesn't exist. Unless Gene Roddenberry himself told us that Spock is actually fully vulcan (impossible since he's dead,) The character stands as is.

== Spock's ranks ==

Does anyone, know how to seperate Spock's ''Lieutenant Commander'' and ''Commander'' rank insignias? They appear stuck together on the article info box. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] 17:10, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

== From the Personal Life section ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;In the non-canon novel Yesterday's Son, Spock is revealed to have fathered a son while trapped in the past on the subsequently destroyed planet Sarpeidon. In the sequel, Time for Yesterday, '''Zar''' returns to mindmeld once more with the Guardian of Forever.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(Emphasis added.)

Interesting idea. I assume the novel had it that time flowed at disparate rates in the two eras. (Otherwise I'd have to steal a quote from an unworthy movie, to wit: &quot;Fast worker, that guy!&quot;)

But I digress. To get to the point, this is the son of Spock and Zarabeth, and his name is Zar, true? Then his name should appear in the first sentence; otherwise it's vague who Zar is. --[[User:CPWinter|Chris]] 19:59, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

== Misplaced trivia item ==

One of the trivia items ends with &quot;Leondard Nimoy voiced Galvatron, a reincarnation of Megatron usually voiced by Frank Welker in Transformers: The Movie.&quot;  However, this is a trivia item that could stand alone -- but not here.  It would belong in the [[Leonard Nimoy]] article.--[[User:Will Pittenger|Will]] 05:16, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

== George Lindsey ==

During the TVLand marathon of TOS this past weekend (I believe it was during &quot;Shore Leave&quot;), Nimoy stated that Rodenberry's first choice for for Spock was [[George Lindsey]].  Any other cite for this? --[[User:Gadget850|Gadget850 ( Ed)]] 15:17, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== Article Format Comparison: Spock and James T. Kirk ==

The two articles [[Spock]] and [[James T. Kirk]] are written in very different formats.  While reading &quot;[[Spock]]&quot;, it is clear that the article is talking about a fictional character in a fictional universe, and appropriate phrasing and references to the actor ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) are used throughout.  &quot;[[James T. Kirk]]&quot; is written in much more of an &quot;in-universe&quot; style, with only passing reference made to the fact that the Star Trek universe is, in fact, entirely fictional.

I make no assertion as to which is more appropriate.  However, due to the similarities in the characters referenced in both articles, it seems like a consistent style should be adhered to.  My question is simply, then, '''which format should we use?'''  Once a format is decided upon, the other article should be modified accordingly.

Does anyone else agree that it doesn't really make sense to say this in the lead? It's not like there's an ongoing T.V. show and Nimoy and Quinto switch off playing him week to week. I think it would make much more sense to say &quot;The character will be portrayed by both Nimoy and [[Zachary Quinto]] in the 2008 film [[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]. I will change it to this unless anyone disagrees. --[[User:DanyaRomulus|DanyaRomulus]] 22:37, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, it would be more correct to say that he's the ''only'' alien in the permanent cast. In fact, apart from Spock, I can't think of any other alien character that appeared in more than one episode. ([[Harry Mudd]] and perhaps a Star Fleet commodore or two appeared in multiple episodes, but obviously they were all humans.) — [[User:Loadmaster|Loadmaster]] ([[User talk:Loadmaster|talk]]) 03:52, 28 February 2008 (UTC)

== Ancestry ==

While it's mentioned in the article for [[Amanda Grayson]], it's not mentioned here that one of Spock's ancestors is (implied to be) [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], quoting a line from [[Sherlock Holmes]] in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|Star Trek VI]]''. Shouldn't that fact be included in this article as well? — [[User:Loadmaster|Loadmaster]] ([[User talk:Loadmaster|talk]]) 03:46, 28 February 2008 (UTC)

:I went ahead and added it, as it's a direct quote from Spock himself. — [[User:Loadmaster|Loadmaster]] ([[User talk:Loadmaster|talk]]) 19:19, 27 April 2008 (UTC)

I disagree that Spock's use of the quote means that one of his ancestors is implied to be Arthur Conan Doyle. I've always interpreted that scene as Spock taking the credit for the quote. That seemed to be a running gag in this movie, as in the original series - the Klingons claiming that they wrote the &quot;original Hamlet&quot;, or Chekov claiming that the Russions invented just about everything. [[User:Theepdought|Theepdought]] ([[User talk:Theepdought|talk]]) 20:28, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

:I don't follow your logic. Spock said:
::'''''An ancestor of mine''' maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.''

:I'll have to dig around to find the article, but Meyer and Nimoy have both said this was a joke, not meant to imply anything about Spock's actual ancestry, but just a throwaway joke.  It comes off in the film as a joke.  I can't believe anyone would take this seriously enough to say that Spock was descended from Conan Doyle.  The mind boggles.  [[User:Sir Rhosis|Sir Rhosis]] ([[User talk:Sir Rhosis|talk]]) 02:59, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

**I think the current wording is safe, since it's an implied conclusion derived from [[Star Trek canon|canonical works]]:
::''In the movie Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Spock quotes a line from a Sherlock Holmes novel, saying that it was said by an ancestor of his, '''implying''' that he is maternally related to Arthur Conan Doyle.''
:If anyone discovers that it was meant as a joke, we can change it then. — [[User:Loadmaster|Loadmaster]] ([[User talk:Loadmaster|talk]]) 22:45, 30 May 2008 (UTC)
::Ok, I am new here, so I hope I'm not out of line - but isn't an implied conclusion OR? The    policy page on OR states ''Drawing conclusions not evident in the reference is original research regardless of the type of source.'' It seems to me that the claim that Spock is maternally related to ACD is a conclusion drawn from his &quot;ancestor of mine&quot; quote; yet it is equally valid to conclude that Spock was (mis)attributing the quote to a Vulcan paternal ancestor. Using the logic offered above, one could argue that it is implied that Shakespeare was a Klingon (You haven't studied Hamlet until you've read it in the original Klingon - quote to that effect from the movie).

This proposal violates the usage of a primary source per [[WP:OR]]. As such, I'll be removing the text.

And for those of you who like &quot;in-universe&quot; answers, remember that Star Trek is set in the future, and that by that time, vulcans have had opportunities for experiencing Earth media. Just because an ancestor of Spock's may have used the phrase, doesn't mean that that ancestor ''originated'' the phrase.

== Dept. Color Identification with Cast ==

In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spock&amp;oldid=261180460 this revision], I added red, blue and gold to the rank column of the character profiles. It seems appropriate to not only identify their rank but their department service color. Especially with the new movie coming out and this being such a major identifier as to the characters. No where else in wiki does this information appear. My changes were reverted once, so I improved them. In the event they are reverted again, I put this argument forth to general wiki consensus as to whether they should be kept and improved upon.

::::If you say so. I will leave that up to others to weigh in. The franchise has set up clear canon, that gold=command and red-support until the Next Generation ear, blue=science always. Paramount continues to honor this tradition in the release of their merchandise. However, the colour coding of divisions is more than just a costume design element. It is identifiable with the characters. Kirk is a yellow shirt, scotty - red, and Spock is blue. They are hardly superfluous. Finally, these colours continue to be identified with the characters despite the movies. If you wanna argue  reconciliation of colours for divisions, then you have to forget that Kirk's early uniforms were actually green and just looked gold under lights. Fact is in the canon universe, gold, red and blue outlast the short-lived colour confusion which might be caused by the movies and just as easily dismissed as the fact the original gold uniforms were actually green.--[[Special:Contributions/75.51.184.49|75.51.184.49]] ([[User talk:75.51.184.49|talk]]) 02:32, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

Simply flashing the dubious badge of canon isn't a ticket to play here. And color-coding the articles is almost assuredly the wrong way to proceed here. Find some citations, make an article, anf ''then'' bring the tiopic of color-coding the articles to the ''Star Trek'' Wikiproject.

== Spock image ==

Anyone know why the image [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spock&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=268241658 was deleted]? It looks like a mistake, but in case it wasn't, It's a notable, cited portrayal of the character, unlike the Dan Akroyd, et al skit with ears. I am putting it back in under the depiction section, where it was before; as well, I am also adding in the other portrayals. - [[User:Arcayne|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''Arcayne'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Arcayne|&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''cast a spell'''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 14:18, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

Additionally, I think its best to preserve a chronological order to the images. After Nimoy's placeholder image, which remains the most iconic of the portrayals, we need to follow both chronological as well as article order. One isn't more &quot;important&quot; than the other; thy are both portrayals of the same character. - [[User:Arcayne|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''Arcayne'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Arcayne|&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''cast a spell'''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 17:27, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:One reason it makes sense to put Quinto above is that on high-resolution displays, the Quinto picture gets shoved all the way down into the reception area. That wholly separate section might be a more appropriate place to put the fanboy depiction, i.e. a result of popularity. I can't find anything in the MOS about prioritizing images -- however, Quinto's appearance is actually mentioned in the &quot;depictions&quot; section, whereas Stacey's isn't. --[[User:EEMIV|EEMIV]] ([[User talk:EEMIV|talk]]) 17:38, 4 February 2009 (UTC)
::First of all, everyones display is different. Secondly, I am reacting a bit negatively to the characterization of notable, citable information as fanboy crud.It could be just as easily - and as negatively - suggested that there was a favoritism for Quinto over any other portrayal than Nomoy's, and that would be undue weight as well. I don't know if its in the MOS either, but they are discussed in order of portrayal, and so it follows that the images should be used thusly. - [[User:Arcayne|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''Arcayne'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Arcayne|&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''cast a spell'''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 17:44, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

=== Pre-Stacey and other fan portrayals ===

Unless there is some third-party coverage/commentary on these other actors -- whether in Phase II or elsewhere -- I don't think it's necessary to list them, esp. since they are non-notable actors and there's as yet no indication of third-party commentary on/notability of fan portrayals of Spock specifically (i.e. separate from a notable fan series). This gets into the realm of trivia -- are we also going to list the folks who play Spock in Hidden Frontier? in machanime? the high school play? The trivia about these two actors' appearances is probably more appropriate in the fan series article itself. Simply listing them here without any context about their performance, or indication that anyone cared enough about their performances to write something about it, is tangential trivia. --[[User:EEMIV|EEMIV]] ([[User talk:EEMIV|talk]]) 17:34, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:Of course, having added them, I disagree. The Wikipedia is full of actors without articles who portray parts in notable films. As they are the most notable portrayals of Spock, we use them. This isn't a slippery slope, as you are suggesting. I don't recall Spock being portrayed in ''Hidden Frontier'', but then, I don't follow that as much (production quality is lower while 90210-esque drama and bad acting is high), and I don't recall other portrayals that meet the threshold for inclusion. - [[User:Arcayne|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''Arcayne'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Arcayne|&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''cast a spell'''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 17:48, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

::I haven't referred to &quot;crud&quot; (NB above). I am saying, however, that the relatively new and popular fan series does not convey notability to individual actors' portrayals or appearances in it. Cawley's performance garnered a smidgen of third-party commentary in Wired, hence the inclusion of that specific portrayal in the Kirk article. I see barely any evidence that Stacey's portrayal has garnered even that much attention -- but his affiliation with the movie and apparently close likeness to Quinto etc. seems worth including. But barely -- Google isn't the best meter for notability, but [http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;q=&quot;Brandon+Stacey&quot;+Spock&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f searching for &quot;'Brandon Stacey' Spock&quot;] rapidly degenerates into unreliable fan sites.  The other two -- plus however many other fan portrayals there are out there -- don't even have that much commentary or discussion. Is there &quot;favoritism&quot; for Quinto? Only insofar as he's involved in a significant studio release that has already received significant third-party coverage of his specific portrayal; not so much these others. --[[User:EEMIV|EEMIV]] ([[User talk:EEMIV|talk]]) 17:57, 4 February 2009 (UTC)
:::Sorry to get back to this so late, EEMIV. I agree that there is a lot of unreliable info out there, but I think the characterization of Cawley's  mention in the ''Wired'' article as a &quot;smidgen&quot; is a bit unfair. Anything over a column inch is pretty much an article. Cawley had the entire page, and Stacey had 2-3 column inches. We aren't going on an on about Stacey's portrayal except to take a direct quote from the notable article we do have. If folk start adding in Stacey's favorite color or ice cream flavor, we can begin knuckling down. i think we are on solid ground here, however. - [[User:Arcayne|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''Arcayne'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Arcayne|&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''cast a spell'''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 14:39, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

I think that, with the restart of the franchise, we need to create a side-by-side image of Nimoy/Quinto for the infobox.

Stacy's comments are reliably cited, and speak specifically to the incorporation of Spock's interpretation into his characterization. It isn't an ad for the fan series, but is rather a comment by a player in the fan series who portrays this same fictional character, and one which has particular relevance to the portrayal in not only the fan series, but the original Nimoy interpretation of the character and the more recent one by Quinto. - [[User:Arcayne|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''Arcayne'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Arcayne|&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''cast a spell'''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] 15:19, 11 May 2009 (UTC)

== Other portrayals in Paramount's Star Trek releases ==

Spock has been portrayed in Paramount's Star Trek TV and film works by several actors other than the three currently listed in the infobox. Specifically, I'm referring to these actors:

* Billy Simpson provided the voice of Spock as a child in the animated Star Trek episode &quot;Yesteryear&quot; (1973).
* Carl Steven played Spock at age 9 in ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' (1984).
* Vadia Potenza played Spock at age 13 in ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock''.
* Stephen Manley played Spock at age 17 in ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock''.
* Joe W. Davis played Spock at age 25 in ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock''.
* Carey Scott provided the voice of &quot;Young Spock&quot; in a deleted scene of ''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989).

(Spock's birth is also portrayed in ''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'', but I have been unable to find the name of the infant actor who played Spock in that scene.)

Is there a reason for the omission of these actors from the infobox and the body of the article? I understand why fan film portrayals of Spock are controversial, but these are portrayals by professional actors in Star Trek episodes and movies produced by Paramount Pictures.

::FWIW, Spock had a a circle beard because it is technically a goatee with a ''connected'' mustache, but a Van Dyke and a cirlce beard are both still types of goatees.  Perhaps in the initial reference it can be called a circle beard goatee and then just a goatee there after.  In modern times, all three terms are acceptable and most people probably think of [[Dick Van Dyke]] and not [[Anthony Van Dyck]] when that term comes up in conversation.

== Was Spock ever married? ==

I don't mean by this the episode in the original series in which Spock is conned into gladitorial combat with Kirk for a scheming Vulcan girlfriend whom Spock promptly dumps.  In the New Generation episode, ''Sarek'', Picard tells his officers that he met old Sarek previously, &quot;years ago, at his son's wedding.&quot;  Picard presumably wasn't even born, certainly not yet traveling in space, when that original series episode (without a wedding) took place.  No mention is ever made of Spock ever being married in any film or TV episode.  It could not have been a wedding of Sybok, since his existence (or at least his connection to Sarek) was utterly unknown until the fifth movie, ''ST: The Final Frontier'', where he becomes known only shortly before he dies, so even someone then in Starfleet wouldn't have been in attendance at a wedding of Sybok.  In a subsequent TNG episode, ''Unification I'' (in which Sarek dies while Picard tries to track down Spock on Romulus), Picard says he met Spock only once, and Spock is repeatedly spoken of as &quot;Sarek's son&quot; as if Sarek had no other son.  So a question arises, was the wedding Picard mentioned that of Spock or of some other son of Sarek (presumably born after the events in The Final Frontier)??

== 2009 film ==

I believe the 2009 film cannot be considered cannon because of numerous inconsistencies with the rest of the series. In the bar scene in the beginning of the film Uhura orders synthetic '''Cardassian''' ale. The federation does not meet the cardassians until 2348. The ale is replicated. Replicators are not invented yet. Nero's &quot;mining ship&quot; is way to large and powerful. It was supposedly built around 2379 and the beginning of the film takes place in 2387, eight years after Star Trek Nemesis. The producers are not going to tell us that in eight years the romulans were building ships so massive that Nero's ship is &quot;small&quot;. There are numerous other minor inconsistencies, but these are some of the main ones. --[[User:Alpha Quadrant|Alpha Quadrant]] ([[User talk:Alpha Quadrant|talk]]) 02:36, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

===Let's break it down===
&quot;Spock is closely associated with the voyages of the Starship Enterprise, serving as science officer and first officer, and later as commanding officer of the late 23rd- and early 24th Century iterations of the vessel. After retiring from the United Federation of Planets Starfleet, he goes on to serve as a Federation Ambassador, responsible for the détente between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. In his later years he serves as Federation Ambassador to Romulus and becomes involved in the ill-fated attempt to save the Romulan Empire from a rogue supernova.&quot;
:In one short paragraph I've summarised his career in the nutshell.  The detail follows in the main section further down the page.  If I'm a user dropping by to read about Spock, I would expect to see a short summary of the character's IU history. -- [[User:Jake Fuersturm|Jake Fuersturm]] ([[User talk:Jake Fuersturm|talk]]) 19:22, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

----

&quot;Spock's mother and father are Human and Vulcan respectively. This mixed heritage, as well being the first Vulcan to serve in Starfleet serves as an important plot element in many of the character's appearances. Along with James T. Kirk and Leonard McCoy he is one of the three central characters in the Original Series episodes and films.&quot;

== Review ==

Since there was a call at [[WT:TREK]], I've appeared! Some general impressions and comments.
*I think it's better from a readability standpoint and in keeping with [[WP:WAF]] to put the development of the character before the character summary, and sprinkle some of the work-specific content into the relevant sections (namely, Spock's death.) As it currently reads, the first section of the article is a repetitive, &quot;In X, Y...&quot; You can break all those paragraphs into a more streamlined form.
*[[:File:Star Trek-Jacob Kogan-Child Spock.jpg]] doesn't meet NFCC.
*Obviously, the biggest shortcoming right now is the lack of general reception. It's the hardest to find, but the most important. Forget UGO, he's been a massively important character for decades. There's got to be more scholarship on how he was recieved, as well as the ethical considerations of the Vulcan logic (although some of that may simple be too specific for Spock and should go in the Vulcan article. Part of the problem may be the division into &quot;Reception&quot;/&quot;Cultural impact&quot; sections. How was the character originally seen by critics back in '67?
*I think quoting the Spock principle in full seems like overkill.
*Facial hair as it's own section? Eh.... I think the image can go too.
*No love for ''TAS''?

:Hey David, thanks for the comments, I've got a few comments/queries, please let me know what you think:
:#I'd thought about changing the order of Development and Depiction, but I wasn't sure if Wikiproject Star Trek may have a preferred template or if this has already been hashed out elsewhere.  When I started editing the article, I compared it against its peers in particular [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] and [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]] for obvious reasons, and those also have Depiction before Development.  Also, the only FA-rated Star Trek character article I could find is for [[Khan Noonien Singh]], and that one also has the Character stuff prior to Design.  Your thoughts?
:#You also note that &quot;the first section of the article is a repetitive&quot;.  I would love to expand it, but based on the reversions done against my edits last Friday, I am worried that it's going to get deleted for being &quot;IU Fancruft&quot;.  I would also note that Kirk, McCoy and Khan's articles have a lot more story summary in them.  Is it OK then for me to expand on it?  I agree that it's a bit thin and repetitive, but I also don't want to be wasting my time.  (And the iteration just before I got started was just a massive chunky paragraph that was impossible to read, which is why I split it up a bit).
:#This is only the third or 4th image that I've uploaded.  I was pretty sure that it met the threshold - can you please explain further on why it's ''not'' NFCC?  And if this isn't NFCC, then why is the pic of Zachary Quinto NFCC?
:#Any thoughts on where I could find more on critical reception?  There's virtually no newspaper coverage scanned in that dates before the 1980s, and I don't really have the resources to go after the scholarly stuff.
:#when I quoted the SCoT decision - my thoughts were along the line that when you see this sort of thing happening, Spock isn't really just for hardcore geekdom anymore, he's mainstream, and let's highlight that fact
:#I'm happy to kill the facial hair section, but it was already there before I arrived.
:#I didn't mention ''TAS'' because it's such a grey area w.r.t canonicity.  I could put stuff in, but again if I start quoting from &quot;Yesteryear&quot; and that Spock used to have a pet sehlat, that I'm just wasting my time once the ''deletionists'' arrive.

::Well, you don't need to go into that much detail in the ''TAS'' stuff, but mention that he appeared in the series and Nimoy lent his voice (it's out-of-universe importance, regardless of canon status.) In regards to Khan, I structured it the way I did because the &quot;design&quot; section also focuses on some scholarly interpretations. Making one section work before the other really just depends on how you structure the information presented; for example some video game articles have a &quot;plot&quot; section before the &quot;gameplay&quot;, and vice versa. If you want to keep it as is, you're going to need to slim down some areas and structure it more as an introduction, i.e. &quot;General info about Spock. Enterprise stuff. In the movies. Blah blah blah&quot;, keeping enough in so that when you hit the design readers aren't going, &quot;wait, they designed what about what? I didn't have any knowledge of that before!&quot;
::The appearances are a bit more in-depth in Khan, but I could get away with it because he's only had two canon appearances.

== Worth Adding References or Links to an Element of Spock's &quot;Proposed&quot; Family History? ==

I refer to Barbara Hambly's book ''Ishmael''.  I can't get this disambiguated title to come out as an internal Wikipedia link, so I'll just paste the text here and hope someone else can fix it -- sorry: 
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_%28Star_Trek%29 
 
Anyway, in this book Hambly sends Spock back in time through the Guardian -- to the world of the TV series &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot;.  And she gets him involved with a character in that series, Aaron Stempel (spelled &quot;Stemple&quot; in her book) . . . who was played by none other than Mark Lenard.  Of course, since he's a human, she makes him an ancestor of the Grayson family -- but it might be worth either discussing or at least linking on the main page here, too.

My two strips of latinum: the term &quot;Spock principle&quot; is a neologism (or whatever you call a made-up phrase) that it appears is used only in that one medical dispatch text. The current phrasing of that paragraph implies (or I at least infer) that the Texas court decision refers not only to the movie quote, but also uses the term &quot;Spock principle&quot; -- which it doesn't. At a minimum, I think the term &quot;Spock principle&quot; needs to go away. My suggestion for actual article improvement is: find a source that identifies Spock's mantra as a reflection of utilitarianism, and phrase that paragraph along the lines of, &quot;Spock's [[utilitarian]] assertion that 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few'&lt;nowiki&gt;[ref#]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is cited in the blah blah Texas court case.&quot; Ideally, the piddly little sentence can get tacked on to the end of something else. --[[User:EEMIV|EEMIV]] ([[User talk:EEMIV|talk]]) 14:31, 31 May 2011 (UTC)

== Removal of Jacob Kogan/Young Spock image ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spock&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=431426802&amp;oldid=431408813]
Would [[user:Erikeltic]] kindly explain his edit summary which states: &quot;Image clearly doesn't meet NFCC&quot;.  As it was uploaded in early April and has withstood almost two months of scrutiny from his fellow editors, I would suggest that it is '''''not clear'''''.  Furthermore, I think the NFCC justification provided for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_Trek-Jacob_Kogan-Child_Spock.jpg Kogan image] is superior to that of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spock_Zachary_Quinto.jpg Quinto image], which was uploaded in May 2009, and so Erik has had a whole two years to remove the latter image from this article. -- [[User:Jake Fuersturm|Jake Fuersturm]] ([[User talk:Jake Fuersturm|talk]]) 03:03, 29 May 2011 (UTC)

You really should familiarize yourself with [[WP:OWN]] before you make that argument again.  It isn't helping your cause.  I made the statement to you that the picture was unnecessary, David pointed out that it doesn't meet NFCC, so I removed it.

:::This is my last response to you tonight until other editors have a chance to add their voice.  Again, Wikipedia is not a forum and should not be treated as one.

*I'd recommend removal, unless sources can be provided that show the role was the subject of a significant amount of critical commentary and the image is necessary for reader comprehension of said commentary.

*I also agree with the image's removal, although more because of the article than the actual image. Per [[WP:NFCC]] #8: the image's  presence does not significantly aid in readers' understanding of the subject, and its omission does not impede understanding. Were the article expanded to include e.g. discussion of the makeup and prostheses, considerations to maintain continuity with Star Trek III/TAS young-Spock appearances, third-party commentary on young actor's resemblance (or not) to Quinto or Nimoy, etc., then yes, I could see the image clearing #8.

*I agree with removing the image as well. Non-free images need contextual significance, and I do not consider Kogan's role major enough to warrant the use of such an image. In contrast, I am fine with the Nimoy image because there is context in the article body that the image supports. For the Quinto image, his role is relatively major, but I think that it could use more context (perhaps likeness to Nimoy's Spock or makeup detail) to warrant its inclusion more strongly.

== Spock's death ==

This section seems overly weightly to me as it focuses on a very small portion of the total development of the character.  The block quote seems very odd placed and could be reduced or converted to inline text.  FWIW, the section related to Kirk's death is much smaller and is in the Depiction section.  It's worth pointing out that the Kirk article has already been a ''Good Article'' nominee.  Thoughts?  [[User:Erikeltic|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#337533&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Erikeltic&lt;/B&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;([[User_talk:Erikeltic|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#337533&quot;&gt;Talk]]&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:14, 3 June 2011 (UTC)

If you're going to conpare Spock's death to Kirk's death, don't forget Spock's death at the time was a much more significant event in Star Trek, since iirc it was the first time a major character died (not like those redshoirt dudes).  Kirk's death in Generations was more than 10 years later, and wasn't as big a deak. And Spock's death and recovery was a major plot point in two more movies (Shatner's ghost-written Kirk novels aren't quite the same thing).  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chartered Wombat|Chartered Wombat]] ([[User talk:Chartered Wombat|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chartered Wombat|contribs]]) 04:32, 5 June 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:: A fuller name was given as ''S'chn T'gai Spock'' in the novel ''Ishmael'' by Barbara Hambly and many have subsequently accepted this. ''However'', this name has not been used in any of the canon productions (as far as I am aware), thus this fuller name ''is not currently official''. This can be included in the article, however, I would not include it in the lede, nor the infobox because of its unofficial status (and only included within the article with the ''clear statement'' that this is a — currently — unofficial name, accepted by some, and only given by the above mentioned book). Although the writers of the recent 2009 movie wanted to include information previously only found in the novels (basically, try to canonize some of the information in these books), Spock's name wasn't one of the things brought into the movie.

:: Note, also, that as far as pronunciation of the above name, we don't have any official orthography or transliteration standards to go by (if Okrand has created one, which is quite possible, he hasn't released it as far as my knowledge goes). For example, the &quot;ch&quot; may be a unit (perhaps a ''tš'' sound, maybe a ''ḥ'' sound, an aspirated ''k'', or something completely different), or may be separate sounds (Okrand made varying use of the letter ''h'' when he designed Klingon, so who knows how he might have designed Vulcan).

I think this is kind of needless. He hadn't been in any Star Trek media since well before Quinto took over. [[User:KarstenO|KarstenO]] ([[User talk:KarstenO|talk]]) 17:41, 27 February 2015 (UTC)
: You might be right that it is needless, but you are wrong about not being in any Star Trek media since well before Quinto took over. He was in a movie with Quinto and they both portrayed Spock. --&amp;nbsp;[[:en:User:GB fan|GB]]&amp;nbsp;[[:en:User talk:GB fan|fan]] 19:24, 27 February 2015 (UTC)

==Spock in 2016 film==
Spock's appearance in the 2016 film, in which a reference to the death of an older &quot;Ambassador Spock&quot; was referred to. Unfortunately, this situation was not explained to the viewing audience in the film. Can it be explained in this article why there are two different Spocks?

== Structure and content of this article ==

I think we need to discuss what the future development of this article is going to be. As I see it, this has the potential to be one of the longest fictional character biographies out there - and so we need to adopt a [[WP:Splitting]] approach - i.e. using this article as an index with summary sections which split off into secondary articles when those sections become too big. For context, I've created an expanded and stand alone version of the Development at [[User:Miyagawa/sandbox2]] which is roughly equivalent in size to the existing Spock article. Since we're meant to keep articles below 100kb (and really below 80kb), adding the entire contents of that sandbox into this article would immediately overwhelm it. Although, I have a feeling that simply ensuring that everything in the main Spock article is properly cited would probably result in adding another 10 to 15kb alone. 

So I propose that a series of second secondary articles should be created to expand upon each individual section, then with summaries of those articles placed here. As I see it - Development and Cultural impact are both ripe for expanding out of the main article. I think Appearances should be completly contained within the main Spock article, and I'm on the fence about Reception. I think that a fully expanded Appearances section would be at least 50% to 75% longer than it is now, plus citations. I want to emphasise that even with the splitting off into secondary articles, we're still looking at the main Spock article being in the 80kb range, and an increase to the number of characters. There is a lot that can be said about the character.

For full disclosure, I attempted to jump start this process earlier in the week. I created [[Development of Spock]] (the same article presently at my sandbox above), and it was speedily deleted on the basis that it was a copy of the main Spock article. There has been a discussion about what to do with it at [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2016 August 8]], and the concensus seems to be to return it to userspace while we discuss here what to do about the main Spock article and any potential sub-articles. 

I would like to propose that I re-draft the existing Development section based on a summary of the article at my Sandbox, and incorporate any elements which are in the existing version into the sandbox edition. Note that some of the elements in the existing Spock article are incorrect (i.e. Nichelle Nichols did not audition for the role of Spock, she auditioned using Spock's part in a script as Uhura's lines had not been written at that point, and afterwards asked if Spock's part was still avaliable). Once complete, I would then like to return the draft to mainspace with it split off from the main Spock article. Then we can see if we can revise the appearances section as it's very brief right now in coverage of ''The Original Series'', really only highlighting a couple of episodes.

: Oh golly, I've always disliked the prospect of splitting articles.  I, myself, am working on an article draft that's reached 88,710 bytes so far, and I have yet to tap two whole books dedicated to the subject (at 440 and 256 pages) nor two handfuls of online sources.  There's nothing I like better than a long, comprehensive article.  However, after reading [[Wikipedia:Splitting]] and [[Wikipedia:Article size]], I concede that it can be beneficial.&lt;p&gt;As for this article, I concur that if it included the content currently at [[development of Spock]], it would be oversize.  The way I would do it: (a) develop the subarticle in userspace, (b) once the subarticle is ready to take live, devolve the corresponding section in the main article to a summary of what's in userspace, then (c) move (or copy?) your userspace draft to the mainspace (e.g. [[cultural impact of Spock]]).  As for what should be spun out, I trust you have a good idea of the inevitable sizes of these subarticles in your head based on the sources you have at your disposal; if you feel those sections would exceed 50–60 kB, then I encourage you to go ahead and break them out into your userspace.&lt;p&gt;Regarding your proposal, I think it's not only excellent, but well designed to avoid any strife, drama, or toe-stepping-upon.  My own 3¢: I would add {{tl|subarticle}} and/or {{tl|summary in}} to [[Talk:Development of Spock|the development article's talk page]] (IAW [[WP:SUBARTICLE]]), and I would include a &quot;Background&quot; section for readers who wind up there without reading this article first.&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?  —  '''[[user:fourthords|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC0000&quot;&gt;fourthords&lt;/span&gt;]] &amp;#124; [[user talk:fourthords|=Λ=]] &amp;#124;'''  17:31, 16 August 2016 (UTC)
::Thanks. The deletion appeal ended up having the Development article returned to mainspace, so I rushed and put links back in. I've just gone and moved the last couple of bits from the Spock article's Development section into the Development article and then went back and summarised the Development article back at the main Spock article. The plan is to overhaul the appearances section on the main Spock article next, because in summarising the Development part, I've actually reduced it by about 9kb, but the appearances update should increase it back up again. I've also just realised that I need to move the reaction to Spock's death part from an older version of the article back in and place within reception. I'll go do that now. [[User:Miyagawa|Miyagawa]] ([[User talk:Miyagawa|talk]]) 10:04, 17 August 2016 (UTC)
:I'm not particularly one for splitting articles, and I'm a bit torn on the userspace content; on one hand there's good detail that should go in, on the other I feel like some of it devolves into pretty minute stuff (like the method acting bit for TMP) and that it'd be better to cut those things and keep them in the main article than spin it out. &lt;font color=&quot;#cc6600&quot;&gt;[[User:David Fuchs|Der Wohltemperierte Fuchs]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;(&lt;font color=&quot;#ff6600&quot;&gt;[[User talk:David Fuchs|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:56, 17 August 2016 (UTC)

== Portrayed by ==

&quot;Portrayed by Leonard Nimoy (1966–91; 2009–16 (photograph))&quot;
Considering that Nimoy died in 2015, he could not have portrayed Spock in 2016. A photograph is a prop, not a portrayal. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 15:13, 8 December 2016 (UTC)
:*I concur. His final on screen role was in ''into Darkness''. Otherwise, James Doohan and Deforest Kelley also appeared in ''Beyond''. [[User:Miyagawa|Miyagawa]] ([[User talk:Miyagawa|talk]]) 18:26, 8 December 2016 (UTC)
::*Would you believe that someone had added that to the Scott and McCoy articles as well? And James T. Kirk. And DeForrest Kelley's filmography section. And William Shatner's filmography page. I'm still tracking down all the places this idiocy has spread to. I mean, if that picture counts then every appearance of a Marilyn Monroe poster in a movie counts for her. That is just ridiculous. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 18:43, 8 December 2016 (UTC)

== Spock's full name ==

Spock's full name S'chn T'gai Spock was revealed in the novel Ishmael. I don't know the page number  because I found it on a Google Books preview that doesn't show page numbers. Does the citation have to be a page number or can it be a chapter number?

Someone has suggested that the full name shouldn't go in the article because it's not canon. This is incorrect because there is no Wikipedia policy disallowing the use of tie-in novels. The novel Ishmael was licensed, which means that someone from Paramount had to approve everything that was in the novel, which makes it a reliable source. --[[User:NetSpiker|NetSpiker]] ([[User talk:NetSpiker|talk]]) 07:16, 18 March 2017 (UTC)

After looking through Wikipedia's refernce policies, I found that chapter numbers are an acceptable alternative to page numbers. If there is still something wrong with my citations or some other part of my edits, please correct them instead of reverting them. If you revert them, I won't be able to learn anyhing. --[[User:NetSpiker|NetSpiker]] ([[User talk:NetSpiker|talk]]) 08:55, 18 March 2017 (UTC)

:I think the problem here is you're requiring a policy (or do you mean guideline?) as justification for reverting your additions. First of all, there doesn't need to be a &quot;rule&quot; - clear consensus (which there is here) is good enough. And anyway, there are guidelines, for instance at [[WP:WikiProject Star Trek]]: Under the section &quot;Non-canon&quot;, it states &quot;they are not official, and if included should always be clearly attributed to their source, and not presented as 'true' in the fictional universe.&quot; When you say &quot;Spock's full name [...] was revealed in the novel Ishmael&quot;, it sounds like you're treating that as &quot;true&quot; for the entire fictional universe, which it's not. Putting it in the lead especially gives it the appearance of being &quot;true&quot; for the entire universe to the reader as well, and that's extremely misleading. If Spock's name as written in the novel needs to be included, it should be presented in a way that clearly indicates it's not universally true. And then, if it's just in one novel, is it really necessary to include it at all? I would probably say no. --[[User:Fru1tbat|Fru1tbat]] ([[User talk:Fru1tbat|talk]]) 13:21, 19 March 2017 (UTC)

This is a common misconception. People think that when something is non-canon, that means it is not true in the fictional universe. Actually, it just means that the writers who make future Star Trek stories are not required to be consistent with it, but they can choose to do so anyway, and they often do. The names Hikaru Sulu, Nyota Uhura, George Kirk and Winona Kirk first appeared in novels and only later appeared in movies. The fact that the S'chn T'gai family name has not yet been mentioned in a movie is no reason to treat it differently. Every Star Trek novel ever published needed to be approved by Paramount, so they are just as valid as the TV series and movies.

I never said the S'chn T'gai name only appeared in one novel. ''Ishmael'' is just the first novel it appeared in. It also appeared in the novels ''Beneath the Raptor's Wing'', ''To Brave The Storm'', ''Uncertain Logic'' and ''The Tears of Eridanus'', so it's a well-established name. --[[User:NetSpiker|NetSpiker]] ([[User talk:NetSpiker|talk]]) 00:53, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

And also, there is no consensus, since different editors gave different reasons for reverting my edits. --[[User:NetSpiker|NetSpiker]] ([[User talk:NetSpiker|talk]]) 00:54, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

:Ok, thanks for clarifying that the name appeared more than once (I don't read the novels). As for your specific arguments: If something from a non-canon source is accepted as generally true (or has become so), that's fine, but it will need a good cite (from a canon source) to back it up. The fact that in previous cases, names introduced in novels later appeared in films doesn't prove anything - for a particular case, it was non-canon before it appeared in a film, and canon afterward. It doesn't mean everything included in novels (even multiple novels) is &quot;true&quot;. The whole idea of the source being considered non-canon means precisely that it ''isn't'' universally true. That's a much, much larger debate that we're not going to solve here. Most importantly, as for there being no &quot;consensus&quot; because the reasons are different, the consensus here is clearly against inclusion, and the reasons one editor or another may cite don't have to be exactly the same. --[[User:Fru1tbat|Fru1tbat]] ([[User talk:Fru1tbat|talk]]) 11:44, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

I started a discussion about non-canon Star Trek names over at [[Wikipedia talk: WikiProject Star Trek]], which I should've done from the start. I suggest we stop talking here, so we don't have essentially the same discussion running in two different places. --[[User:NetSpiker|NetSpiker]] ([[User talk:NetSpiker|talk]]) 12:04, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

Just for clarification, I have no objection to a non-canon source being cited in an article. I just don't think it belongs in the lead. It should be stated later down in the article. [[User:SonOfThornhill|SonOfThornhill]] ([[User talk:SonOfThornhill|talk]]) 16:39, 20 March 2017 (UTC)</text>
