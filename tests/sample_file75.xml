      <text xml:space="preserve">I desperately looked for a way to redirect '''ad hoc query''' to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc#Ad_hoc_querying] but to no avail. I did see that that is not possible, but there has to be a better way than the hack job i pulled. If anyone can, '''please''' leave a note on my talk page as to how i might do this more gracefully.
