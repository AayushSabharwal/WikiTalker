This &quot;article&quot; may have been inspired by a package insert from the product...Why does it exist, and is it Wiki quality?--[[Special:Contributions/75.164.155.194|75.164.155.194]] ([[User talk:75.164.155.194|talk]]) 04:55, 23 July 2016 (UTC)

Yes, this seems to be the case, and the tone seems to be that of a cookbook, or a story (and does not go with the [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|Manual of Style]]).
The article should probably be rewritten to a more neutral tone.--[[User:LearnerGenius|learnergenius]] ([[User talk:LearnerGenius|talk]]) 01:11, 29 July 2016 (UTC)

== Appropriate tag(s) ==

This page definitely needs a lot of work, but I don't know what tags are appropriate. I'm putting a general cleanup one, but feel free to delete it and replace with a more appropriate one.--[[User:LearnerGenius|learnergenius]] ([[User talk:LearnerGenius|talk]]) 03:37, 14 November 2016 (UTC)</text>
